// Step 1: User clicks if they are Parker or Owner
// Step 2: User enters in personal info
// Step 3: If owner, enter in number of spots to register, intialize all spots to valid
// Step 4: If parker, return list of valid parking spots with location







//To Test
// Step 1: Create owner account with 8 spots
// Step 2: Make sure some spots are valid and some invalid
// Step 3: Create driver account and buy a spots
// Step 4: Add functionality for owner to change spots availability at will unless driver is parked there
